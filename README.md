# Building A Graph Data Model Out of the NBA Dataset
## Overview
This project builds a graph data model out of the NBA dataset to analyze relationships between players, teams, and games. The model helps answer questions like:<br/>
1. Which players have played together in games?
2. Which players have been part of which teams during specific time periods?
3. The evolution of team rosters over time
4. Player connections through shared team affiliations
